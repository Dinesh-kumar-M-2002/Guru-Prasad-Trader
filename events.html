In the capital market, there are two groups of entities. One is a merchant, and the other is an investor. There are some chances that an individual will concurrently do both trading and investing. But notwithstanding the immense disparity between the investor and the dealer.

In individual businesses or a single entity, an investor spends his capital. He aims at the underlying financials of the enterprise and has long-term expectations for expenditure. He buys, and he feels the business can expand better over time and then the market price can therefore go up.

He would not care about the fluctuations of the sector or equity exchange levels. The person who is a dealer, on the other side, focuses on shifts in the price and volume of a share. He attempts at a low price to purchase the stocks and sell at a high price to gain money in the exchange. He does not mess about the company’s fundamentals or the survival of his venture. It just analyses the bullish or bearish momentum of the capital market and, respectively, the stock price and exchange. Shri. Guru Prasad, “Best Trading Award winner in Traders Carnival in Trade times 2019”, a “Lead expert in trading strategies” having a wide-ranging experience of    21   years in the field of intense trading will give an Exclusive Live Trading and Training “Never before in the History of Financial  Market”  on  10  &   11th   Dec  2022 between 9.00 am to 5.00 pm at  ITC   KOHENUR,  KNOWLEDGE CITY,   PLOT NO.5,  SURVEY NO. 83/1,   HYDERABAD, MADHAPUR,  TELANGANA   –   500081.  intense training is intended for all investor, small traders, senior traders, and dealer styles in our live trading classes here when teaching our courses</p>
